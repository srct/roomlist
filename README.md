Project Description

On Contributing
---

PROJECT NAME welcomes all the help it can get. Even if you don't feel like you can be helpful the more technical aspects, we definitely need designers, technical writers, and testers.

There are many things that can be done with this project (see the "To Do" section), but sometimes it's the small things that count, so don't be afraid of contributing just a small spelling mistake.

If you need help at all please contact and SRCT member. We want people to contribute, so if you are struggling, or just want to learn we are more than willing to help.

The project lead for this project is **PERSON**. *PERSON'S EMAIL ADDRESS*
