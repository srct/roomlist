    <h2>What is RoomList?</h2>
    <p>
      Roomlist is a privacy-focused software tool to allow Mason students to
      safely and securely share their housing information, aiding the educational
      development of resident communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students can choose to share their housing information with other students
      on their floor, in their building, or across campus, and link to their
      social media accounts.
    </p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>Who uses RoomList?</h2>
    <p>
      RoomList is available only to current students and faculty at George Mason
      University with full active user accounts. Users must log in with their Mason
      credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      This exclusivity provides an easy, safe, closed community within which students can
      elect to internally share their housing information.
