    <h2>What is Roomlist?</h2>
    <p>
      Roomlist is a privacy-focused software tool to allow Mason students to
      safely and securely share their housing information, aiding the educational
      development of resident communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students can choose to share their housing information with other students
      on their floor, in their building, or across campus, and link to their
      social media accounts. They can also find other students by degree program to
      aid formation of study groups.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>Who uses Roomlist?</h2>
    <p>
      Roomlist is available only to current students and faculty at George Mason
      University with full active user accounts. Users must log in with their Mason
      credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      This exclusivity provides an easy, safe, closed community within which students can
      elect to internally share their housing information.
