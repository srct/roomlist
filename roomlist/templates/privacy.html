      Roomlist was designed with student privacy foremost in mind. First, all
      information is accessible only to users with full GMU credentials.
      When your account is created, you have the option to make your housing
      information viewable to your floor (the default choice), your entire
      building, or campus-wide. When you choose to make your housing information
      viewable campus-wide, it is also viewable to non-resident students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your profile information is as provided through the university, and
      we are unable to make any change to your name, major, or email except
      as changed by the university.

      If a service is getting a lot of use, we will try to provide more
      support and focus our attention on that service. Our user of your

      choose to upload to the site is limited to improving your experience.
